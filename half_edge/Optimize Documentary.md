Reworked my pair builder so its not two for loops in each other and instead its one for loop with a for loop with only 2 to 4 elementents in them
This made the algortihm run twice as fast on the 7 sub.

Texted to see if i stopped calling size funtion in every loop and instead had a long that keept that vaule, it made it go 2sec faster on the 7 sub. 

Reworked so when caculating the averegin on every new point it does not run through every edge and instead just the edges that is conected to that point. 
This speeded up the algorithm on 7 sub from 14 sec too 0.5 sec and 7.6 sec on 10 sub
